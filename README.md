## What ?

A simple weather webapp giving temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, cloud, uv index and visibility.
Made to be accessed on all devices (responsive)

## How ?

Use [weatherstack.com](https://weatherstack.com/documentation) API. The free version of the API is limited to 1000 calls / month so we have two watch dogs to make sure we do not exceed that monthly limit :
* By default, weather data is pulled once a day at 6:30am, Paris, France time
* It is possible to force a new pull once per hour
